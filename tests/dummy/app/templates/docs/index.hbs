# Introduction

## Goals

This ember addon tries to tackle **ember addon documentation** with simplicity and composition in mind.

* It doesn't directly rely on markdown
* It relies heavily on other tools:
  - [tailwindcss](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss)
  - [@tailwindcss/typography](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography)
  - [ember-prism](https://github.com/shipshapecode/ember-prism)
  - [ember-code-snippet](https://github.com/ef4/ember-code-snippet)
  - [ember-md-block](https://github.com/concordnow/ember-md-block)
* It follows Ember architecture

## Disclaimer

It's primarly use as an internal tool for [Â© Concord](https://www.concordnow.com/) and it's not meant to be a solution for everyone.

**Use it at your own risks.**

## Inspired by

* [@docfy/ember](https://github.com/josemarluedke/docfy)
* [ember-cli-addon-docs](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-cli-addon-docs)
